/*
  # Create clients table for unregistered clients

  1. New Tables
    - `clients`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique identifier for the client
      - `full_name` (text) - Client's full name
      - `phone` (text, nullable) - Client's phone number
      - `email` (text, nullable) - Client's email address (optional)
      - `notes` (text, nullable) - Additional notes about the client
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - When the client was created
      - `created_by` (uuid) - Admin who created this client (references profiles)

  2. Changes
    - Add `client_id` column to `appointments` table to reference unregistered clients
    - Keep `user_id` in appointments for registered users
    - One appointment can have EITHER user_id OR client_id, not both

  3. Security
    - Enable RLS on `clients` table
    - Admins can view, create, update, and delete all clients
    - Regular users cannot access the clients table

  4. Notes
    - This table is for clients who don't have app accounts
    - They are created by admins for appointment management
    - No authentication required for these clients
